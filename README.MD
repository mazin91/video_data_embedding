Video-based data hiding is the process of embedding information inside video sequences. 
The technique of data hiding in videos is preferred in general for many reasons. 
One of them is the high bit-rate and the high amount of information stored in streaming videos. 
This helps very much in hiding secured data from observing and noticing. 
There are many techniques to embed the data inside the video sequences. 
This data embedding process results in distortion in the video signal called embedding distortion. 
Often, this distortion is very small as we are going to see in testing resutls. 
Video-based data embedding techniques are used in various applications such as authentication, content-protection, and secret communications.

This project is based on the standard MPEG video format.
